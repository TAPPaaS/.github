## Introduction

TAPPaaS is a cloud on a plate. Fundamentally it delivers a easy way of standing up a private cloud with all the qualifications of an enterprise cloud 
without the hassle of designing and testing all the boring stuff such as Backup, Firewalls, certificate management, proxy management, identity management and single sign on.

Documentation is on [TAPPaaS.org](tappaas.org)

The TAPPaaS repository is the main repository for TAPPaaS

Contribution contain TAPPaaS modules that have been contributed by other organisations

## Status
